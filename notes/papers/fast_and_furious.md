### Title
Fast and Furious: Real Time End-to-End 3D Detection, Tracking and Motion Forecasting with a Single Convolutional Net

### General Idea
3D convolutions acrross space and time over a bird's eye view (BEV) representation of the 3D world, which is very effcient in term of both memory and computation. 


### Key Notes
* Self-driving has four steps:
1. Detection
2. Object tracking
3. Motion forecasting
4. Motion planning
