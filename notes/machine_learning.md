Standard linear regression models with standard estimation techniques make a number of assumptions about the predictor variables, 
the response variables and their relationship. Numerous extensions have been developed that allow each of these assumptions to be 
relaxed (i.e. reduced to a weaker form), and in some cases eliminated entirely. Generally these extensions make the estimation 
procedure more complex and time-consuming, and may also require more data in order to produce an equally precise model.
